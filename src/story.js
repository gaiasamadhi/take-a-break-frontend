Our team is passionate to create a product that contributes positively to a user’s mental and physical health. The work to this point builds off of the proven idea that meaningful micro-breaks throughout the day helps users recover from accumulated stress.

Stressful situations are commonplace in our lives, one major source of stress is related to our jobs. Studies have shown that job stress threatens the health of workers [1]. Health care expenditures are nearly 50% greater for workers who report high levels of stress. – Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine [2]. Extended periods of stress or frequent exposure to stress can cause mental, physiological, and physical illnesses. In addition to health effects, studies show that stressful working conditions are actually associated with increased absenteeism, tardiness, and intentions by workers to quit their jobs-all of which have a negative effect on the bottom line.

Stress management is a critical step in stress recovery and should be incorporated into a regular workday. The traditional methods of stress recovery such as off-work time, weekends, and vacation are effective methods of stress recovery, however, given the high demands of the workplace, micro-breaks taken during work hours can benefit both the worker’s health and the individual’s productivity and job satisfaction. Daily micro-break activities incorporated into the workday demonstrate improved levels of workplace well-being [3]. Supervisor support for recovery further improved the level of stress recovery, therefore pushing for normalization/adoption of at work microbreaks dedicated to stress recovery activities of an organization from the top down will yield the most positive results.

Our goal at Recharge is to promote user well being by bringing meaningful and engaging micro breaks to as many users as possible. 

Help us in reaching our goals and share with anyone you know that needs to take a break!`,
